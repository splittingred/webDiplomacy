<h4>Reliability Explained:</h4>

<div class="profile_title">What is Reliability?</div>
<div class="profile_content">
    <p>
        Reliability is how consistently you avoid interrupting games. Any un-excused missed turns hurt your rating. If you have any un-excused
        missed turns in the last 4 weeks you will receive an 11% penalty to your RR for <strong>each</strong> of those delays. It is very important
        to everyone you are playing with to be reliable but we understand mistakes happen so this extra penalty will drop to 5% after 28 days. All of the un-excused
        missed turns that negatively impact your rating are highlighted in red below. Excused delays will only negatively impact your base score, seen below. Mod excused
        delays do not hurt your score in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Live Game:</strong> If a game had phases 60 minutes long or less any excused missed turns will only impact your rating for 28 days total. The penalty is the same,
        5% long term and 6% short term, except the long term penalty is for 28 days and the short term is for 7 days.</br>
        <strong>System Excused:</strong> If you had an "excused missed turn" left this will be yes and will not cause additional penalties against your rating.</br>
        <strong>Mod Excused:</strong> If a moderator excused the missed turn this field will be yes and will not cause additional penalties against your rating.</br>
        <strong>Same Period Excused:</strong> If you have multiple un-excused missed turns in a 24 hour period you are only penalized once with the exception of live games,
        if this field is yes it will not cause additional penalties against your rating.

    <p>
        Many games are made with a minimum rating requirement so this may impact the quality of games you can enter. If you have more then 3 non-live un-excused missed turns in a year
        you will begin getting temporarily banned from making new games, joining existing games, or rejoining your own games.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1-3 un-excused delays: warnings</li>
        <li>4 un-excused delays: 1-day temp ban</li>
        <li>5 un-excused delays: 3-day temp ban</li>
        <li>6 un-excused delays: 7-day temp ban</li>
        <li>7 un-excused delays: 14-day temp ban</li>
        <li>8 un-excused delays: 30-day temp ban</li>
        <li>9 or more un-excused delays: infinite, must contact mods for removal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Live game excused turns are penalized independently for temporary bans. 1-2 un-excused missed turns in live games will be a warning, and the 3rd, and any after that will
    result in a 24 hour temp ban. The 2 warnings reset every 28 days resulting in significantly more yearly warnings for live game players then the normal system.
