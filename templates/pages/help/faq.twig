        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_1_1" onclick="FAQShow(1, 1); return false;">What is Diplomacy?</button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Diplomacy is a strategy game
                currently published by Avalon Hill and created by Allan Calhamer in 1954.
                In Diplomacy, players practice wartime tactics, employ powerful rhetoric in their negotiations, and make
                friends and enemies while competing to dominate the board.
                Unlike other war games, players submit their orders simultaneously and the entire board is adjudicated
                at once,
                meaning that everyone sees the moves that their competitors made at the same time each and every phase.
                Diplomacy is known as a favorite game for many powerful historical figures, including President John F.
                Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Ray Bradbury, and Walter Cronkite,
                and it is a great game for learning and teaching history, negotiation, patience, and strategy.

        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">No! webDiplomacy is a

                <br><br>
                However, webDiplomacy still needs money for operating costs and regular server maintenance and as such
                we accept and appreciate donations, small or large.
                You are not required to donate and will never be pressured to donate to webDiplomacy, but if you would
                like to donate, you can check out our

        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">There are a number of ways
                that you can help webDiplomacy. The simplest way to help is by
                <a href='help/donations' class='light'>donating.</a> Your donations are used to maintain our server and
                handle generic, everyday operating costs.
                Without donations, webDiplomacy would be unable to continue operating.
                <br><br>
                However, donating is not the only way you can help. If you have time and a fair amount of experience
                playing Diplomacy online,
                we are always looking for skilled, patient, and experienced moderators. webDiplomacy's moderators are
                the best trained and most effective
                of any Diplomacy site online at keeping games free of cheating and ensuring that gameplay is as smooth
                as possible at all times.
                Moderators are also responsible for welcome and assisting new players, assisting with tournaments and
                special games, and managing any player emergencies.
                If you are an experienced, patient Diplomacy player with an aptitude for spotting suspicious behavior
                and a desire to help out on webDiplomacy,
                send us an email at <a href='mailto:{{ moderator_email }}' class='light'>{{ moderator_email }}</a>
                with your username and a brief bit about why
                you think you would make a good moderator. Even if we don't need new moderators right this second, we
                will keep your application on file and you will be
                at the top of our list whenever we need new moderators down the road.
                <br><br>
                If moderating just doesn't sound like your cup of tea but you are a skilled developer, webDiplomacy
                could always use your help.
                Skilled developers with experience in PHP, JavaScript, or SQL, as well as HTML or CSS, can check out <a

            Diplomacy!
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">While it is impossible to
                master the art of Diplomacy, the game itself is an easy game to begin to learn.
                The <a href='intro' class='light'>intro page</a> is a good starting point for learning the basic
                mechanics of the game of Diplomacy online.
                Once you have a good command of how the game works, <a href="gamelistings.php" class='light'>start
                    playing</a>! There is no better way to learn
                beyond the basics than by actually playing the game.
                <br><br>
                If you really want to dive into the more advanced guide of how Diplomacy works, check out
                <a href='http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/diplomacy.pdf' class='light'>Avalon Hill's rulebook</a>
                on Diplomacy.
                Be mindful that Avalon Hill's rulebook is written for those who purchased the board game itself, not for
                those who are playing online, so there are some inconsistencies.
                For example, webDiplomacy does not offer an alternative for six players on the classic board. Instead,
                we offer different Diplomacy boards called
                <a href="variants/list" class='light'>variants</a> where you can play on a different map with different
                amounts of players.
                Using our variant boards, you can play with as many as 34 players or as few as 2.</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_2" onclick="FAQShow(2, 2); return false;">I already know how to play.

        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">If you already know what
                you're doing, <a href="gamelistings.php" class='light'>start playing</a>!
                You can join games that other people have created, take over open positions in ongoing games left
                vacant, or create your own game and allow others to join it.</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_3" onclick="FAQShow(2, 3); return false;">What level of skill should I
            expect in my games?
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Generally, the players that
                you play with can be similar to your skill level.
                As a new player, you will often find yourself playing with other new players, during which time you will
                be able to help each other learn and get better.
                As you get more comfortable, you will probably find yourself in some games with players more experienced
                than you are. You will notice these players
                and hopefully take the opportunity to learn from their tactics and diplomacy to make yourself a better
                player at the same time. Eventually, you may
                become a highly skilled, elite Diplomacy player, and perhaps will end up playing in site sponsored
                tournaments with other highly skilled, elite Diplomacy players.
                <br><br>
                Generally speaking, lower pot games, such as games where each player only bets 5 points, may have more
                players who are new or inexperienced.
                If you are more experienced and play in those games, we encourage you to be patient with new players. We
                were all new players once.
                The best way to welcome a newer player to the site is to play fairly and patiently, and perhaps offer
                constructive criticism that could help
                make them better in the long run.

        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_4" onclick="FAQShow(2, 4); return false;">What are all these settings
            on the game creation page?
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">When you create a game on
                webDiplomacy, you have to specify some settings.
                First and foremost, every game has a name, bet size, and phase length. The name is up to you, so long as
                it abides by our <a href="help/rules" class='light'>site rules</a>.
                You can bet as few as 5 or as many points as you have to your account. Every other player that joins
                will have to match your bet,
                and then when the game is over the points will be distributed according to the
                <a href="help/points#DSS" class='light'>scoring system</a>
                that you choose. Finally, the phase length is how long you have to enter your orders in each phase.
                Since everyone enters their orders simultaneously and in secret,
                pick a deadline that makes sense for how long you want to play. If you want to play an entire game
                today, try a live game with 5-30 minute phase lengths.
                If you only want to check the site every few days, play a game with a longer phase length so you have
                more time.
                <br><br>
                Next, you'll choose the type of game messaging you want to play. By default, your game will be set to
                'all,' or full press messaging, which means everyone
                can speak with everyone else at all times. If you choose 'global only,' or public press, you can only
                send messages globally where everyone can see them.
                If you choose 'no messaging,' or gunboat, you cannot send any messages at all. You can also play 'per
                rulebook,' which is full press during moves phases
                and no press at all during retreat and build phases. Face-to-face Diplomacy is generally played this
                way.
                <br><br>
                You can then choose which one of webDiplomacy's <a href="variants/list" class='light'>variants</a> you
                want to play, which <a href="help/points#DSS" class='light'>scoring system</a>
                you want to use to distribute the points at the end of the game, and whether or not other players in
                your game should be anonymous, which hides their display names.
                You can also set your game to show or hide all draw votes that other players cast and set the minimum <a
                        href='intro#RR' class='light'>reliability rating</a>
                and set the number of phases in which a player can fail to enter orders before they are automatically
                removed from the game.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, you can make your game private by adding an invite code, which is like a password for your game.
                If you are playing a game with anyone that you know
                outside of webDiplomacy, our <a href="help/rules" class='light'>site rules</a> mandate that you add an
                invite code to your game to make it private.
                You can share the invite code with your friends, family, or colleagues so that you can all play your
                game within our rules.</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_5" onclick="FAQShow(2, 5); return false;">What do the 'save' and
            'ready' buttons do?
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">When you are playing a game,
                you can either save your orders, which means that the game will remember them
                and store them for you to change later if you decide to alter them again before the deadline, or ready
                your orders, which means that you do not intend to
                change your orders again. If every player has readied their orders, the game will process to the next
                phase regardless of when the deadline is,
                so if you ready your orders, make sure that you don't want to change them again!</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_6" onclick="FAQShow(2, 6); return false;">Why are my order choices
            red?
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Red order choices are
                unsaved, so if you decide to close your browser or tab, the game will not remember
                the orders that you put in. You should save or ready your orders in order to make sure that the game
                knows what you entered and that you don't end up
                failing to enter orders if the deadline passes.</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_7" onclick="FAQShow(2, 7); return false;">How do I win?</button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">The goal of every game is to
                'solo' the board, or hold the majority of the supply centers available. This is how you win in
                Diplomacy.
                However, it is very difficult to solo the board and thus most Diplomacy games do not end in a solo. That
                is why there are other positive results, such as draws.
                Depending on the <a href="help/points#DSS" class='light'>scoring system</a> of the game, a draw will
                distribute a certain number of points to each surviving player.</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_8" onclick="FAQShow(2, 8); return false;">What happens when I run out
            of points?
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Every player has a certain
                amount of available points and total points. These numbers might be different.
                Your total number of points include the number of points which you have 'bet' into games you're
                currently playing in as well as the points you have in your account.
                Your available number of points includes only those that you could use to continue joining new games.
                While your available points may reach 0 if you have
                spent all of your points on ongoing games, your total number of points never falls below 100. When it
                does, you will automatically be topped off so that you have 100 total points again.
                Thus, while all your points might be tied up in games you're still playing right now, you will never
                truly run out of points, and once those games are finished, you will
                have more points to spend again even if you don't get points back from those games.</p></div>
        <button class="faq_question" name="faq_2_9" onclick="FAQShow(2, 9); return false;">What do those icons mean? (
            <img src='images/icons/tick.png'/>, <img src='images/icons/alert.png'/> , <img src='images/icons/mail.png'/>
            , etc.)
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">If you see an icon

        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">In a full press game, every
                country has tabs to message other players.
                Instead of simply removing the tab for the country that you are playing from your press toolbar, there
                is a section for you to take notes on the game.
                You can send notes to yourself just like you would send press to other players, but nobody can see your
                notes except for you! Feel free to use your notes
                tab as much or as little as you like in all of your games.</p></div>

        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Some players utilize the mute
                function, which allows them to prevent someone they don't like from sending
                them any more messages in that game. If you are muted by another player, the game is not broken and you
                are not in trouble, but you cannot send them any more messages unless they
                decide to unmute you again.</p></div>

                for players to make mistakes when entering their orders.
                The site administrators have received complaints about orders not being adjudicated properly many times.
                However, since webDiplomacy was founded in 2004,
                there has not been a single instance where there was any evidence that our game adjudicator made an
                error. The best thing that you can do to minimize
                misorders in the future is to double check all of your orders, and even if you do, know that they do
                still occasionally happen as we are all humans and make mistakes.</p></div>

                developed in tandem with university researchers and trained on over 160,000 Diplomacy games across
                different scoring systems, different phase lengths, and on various platforms. The AI's strategies and
                tactics are up to standard and provide a challenge for most users as well as a place to experiment,
                learn, and perfect your game.</p></div>

                positions in games that have yet to start that would otherwise be canceled. We also hope that the AI
                will be useful for filling some positions in civil disorder until they are taken over by other players
                so that there are no inactive positions in eligible games.</p></div>

        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Yes, it did! webDiplomacy
                used to have a very basic forum that slowly became more and more problematic
                as webDiplomacy grew. When the site was small, the server load the forum caused was fairly small as
                well, but as the site got bigger and bigger and
                the forum became more popular, it was nearly impossible for the server to operate efficiently without
                erasing significant amounts of site data,
                including most of the old forum. Instead of continuously erasing the forum over and over again as time
                went on, we decided that it was best
                to change the forum entirely. The current forum is much more user friendly than the old one and very
                easy to navigate, plus it does not overload our server.</p></div>

        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">The Ghost Ratings were
                developed by TheGhostmaker as an alternative scoring system to points on webDiplomacy.
                The purpose of the ratings is to more accurately measure the true skill and ability of players by
                weighting games not by the size of the pot but
                by the the type of game they are playing and the ability and skill of the other players in that game. It
                also allows an accurate measurement depicting
                either improvement or regression over time, whereas once players have gained a significant amount of
                points, they generally do not lose all of them again.
                The Ghost Ratings were initially developed in 2008 as a single scoring system but have since been
                expanded on to include various categorizations,
                including individual ratings for full press, gunboat, live, and 1v1 games, as well as to weight variants
                on webDiplomacy differently than the classic board.

            adjudicator work and what is it based on?
        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">webDiplomacy's adjudication
                software is based on the official Diplomacy rules.
                However, in order to adapt to online gameplay where it would be extremely impractical to require players
                to adjudicate games manually,
                webDiplomacy developed a series of scripted tests called the Diplomacy Adjudicator Test Cases, or DATC,
                to lay out exactly how all sorts of tricky situations are processed,
                particularly in the cases where there is ambiguity in the rules.
                <br><br>
                While examining the outputted results of the DATC is not useful or practical for most players, you can
                see the results <a href='datc.php' class='light'>here</a>.
                If you have a question about how a certain scenario would be processed, feel free to ask a question on

        </button>
        <div class="faq_answer" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:15px;"><p class="faq">Unfortunately, it does seem
                that sometimes people will claim that their orders
                came out wrong to cover up the intention of their actions. For example, they may say "I was going to
                stab you, then read your message and changed
                my orders so I wasn't going to stab you, but my old orders came out instead of the new ones! Oh so sorry
                about that!"
                This is not allowed under <a href="help/rules" class='light'>the site rules</a> as it puts an unnecessary
                load on the site moderators by
                falsely claiming that a bug has been introduced on the site. If you are told that a bug caused a mistake
                in their orders, you should reserve some skepticism,
                and remember that the official server alone receives and processes tens of thousands of orders every
                single day yet has never made a mistake processing orders.
                Misorders can and do happen, but they have always been found to be the result of human error, not a
                software error.</p></div>
