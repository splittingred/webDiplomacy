### Installation

README.txt - Installation information. This is legacy and hopefully will be vastly improved in the future.

### Goals

This is a fork of https://github.com/kestasjk/webDiplomacy/, with vastly modernized code. The goal is to get
 webDiplomacy to PSR-4 standards and fully using [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) for templating, separating
 domain logic from rendering.
 
Doing so will eventually allow the more rapid expansion of features and scalability improvements.

This repository is therefore not stable and usable for a webdip server at this time.
